Welcome to the Chaos Awakens Wiki!

Chaos Awakens is a Spiritual Successor of the 1.7.10 mod, called OreSpawn. Chaos Awakens is a reimagination of the mod but still contains the core features such as the ant dimensions and the mod being way too overpowered to work with other mods.

The downloads for Chaos Awakens are available at the website. You can also download the mod from the Curseforge or the Modrinth

Chaos Awakens also has its source code available on GitHub

The mod requires GeckoLib to run and it is recommended to use Just Enough Items and the latest version of Forge.
